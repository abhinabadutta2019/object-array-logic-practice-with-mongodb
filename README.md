// FAQ

//Q-so how many subjects each has, is the number of subjects constant or random?

// Each document has a fixed number of five subjects. The inner loop runs five times, creating a grade object for each of the five subjects and pushing it into the grades array of the current document. The subject is generated as a string with the format "Subject j" where j is the index of the subject in the loop. Therefore, each document has five subjects with names "Subject 1" through "Subject 5". The score for each subject is generated randomly using Math.floor(Math.random() \* 101), which generates a random integer between 0 and 100.

//Q- in this code-- after the data gets generated by--generateDocs(numDocs) function----is it recommended to comment out this part? ---in model/user.js

//It depends on what you want to do with the data generated by the generateDocs function.

// If you have already inserted the data into your MongoDB database using the User.insertMany(docs) method, and you don't need to insert the same data again, then it may be a good idea to comment out the code that generates and inserts the data. This will prevent accidentally duplicating the data in the database.

// However, if you want to continue to use the generateDocs function to generate new data or modify it in some way, then you should not comment out the code that calls the function and inserts the data.

// In general, it's a good practice to comment out code that is not being used, especially if it performs actions like inserting data into a database, to avoid unintended consequences.
